    // Test case 1: Unit Tests    
    // Test individual functions and methods within your Go code for correctness.
    // Verify edge cases, boundary conditions, and error handling.

    // Test case 2: Integration Tests:
    // Test interactions between different components of your application, such as middleware, routers, and database connections.
    // Ensure that components can communicate with each other as expected.

	// Test case 3: API Endpoint Tests:
    // Test each API endpoint for expected responses, status codes, and data correctness.
    // Verify that the API routes and request handling are functioning correctly.

	// Test case 4: Authentication and Authorization Tests:
    // Test authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access protected endpoints.
    // Verify that different roles and permissions are enforced properly.

	// Test case 5: Security Tests:
	// Test for common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
	// Perform penetration testing to identify security weaknesses.

	// Test case 6: Error Handling Tests:
    // Test how your application handles unexpected errors and failures, ensuring it provides meaningful error messages and logs.	

	// Test case 7: Environmental Variations:
    // Test your script under various environments, such as different operating systems, versions of Go, or runtime configurations.
